# Coursera Specialisation: Algorithms and Data-Structures
My solutions for assignments in Coursera Specialisation "Algorithms and Data Structures"


# Course 1: Algorithmic Toolbox
The class covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and many others. 

 ## Week 1: 
 Few sample programming challenges and introduction to testing techniques. 

 ## [Week 2:](https://github.com/gitvino/Coursera-Specialisation-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/tree/master/1_Algorithmic_Toolbox/week2_algorithmic_warmup "Week 2")
 Programming challenges to implement solutions that are faster than the straightforward naive solutions. All challenges are related to Fibonacci series.
